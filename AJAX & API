What are Ajax and Ajax Calls?
AJAX 
Asynchronous JavaScript And XML: Allow us to communicate with remote web servers asynchronously, 
In practice, we make AJAX Calls in our code to request some data from the web server dynamically
(without reloading the page we can use that data in our application)

How does Ajax work?
let's say that our JS application running in the browser(client)
and we want the application to get some data from a web server
ex: Data about countries

so with Ajax, we can do an HTTP request to the server which has that data
The server with then set back a response containing the data(data about countries) that we requested
This communication B/w Client & server all happens asynchronously in the background

Different types of requests?
GET request: To receive data
POST request: TO send data to a server

Note:
When we ask a server to send us some data, That server usually contains an API 
and that API is the one that has the data that we are requested for.

What is API?
Application Programming Interface: a piece of software that can be used by another piece of software 
in order to allow applications to talk to each other and exchange information

Important API:
online API: Application running on a server, that receives requests for data, retrieves that data from the database sends data back as a response
